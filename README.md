# CESNET Anomaly Detection (SARIMA-Based)

This project applies forecasting-based anomaly detection on network traffic using the CESNET-TimeSeries24 dataset. A SARIMA model is used to predict normal flow behavior and detect deviations as potential anomalies.

## Objective

Detect anomalies such as DDoS attacks and outages by forecasting normal traffic and identifying significant residual errors.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: CESNET-TimeSeries24
- **Subset Used**: IP address `103.csv`
- **Metric**: `n_flows` (number of flows per hour)
- **Time Range**: Oct 2023 – July 2024
- **Granularity**: 1-hour aggregated

## Tools Used

- `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels` (SARIMA modeling)
- `scikit-learn` (evaluation metrics)

## Forecasting Setup

- **Model**: `SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,0,168)`
- **Forecast Types**:
  - One-shot 7-day forecast
  - One-shot 2-day forecast
  - Rolling 2-day forecast
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, R²

## ⚠️ Anomaly Detection

- Based on residuals (actual – forecast)
- Methods:
  - 3-Sigma
  - MAD (Median Absolute Deviation)
  - Quantile (1st and 99th percentiles)

## 📌 Notable Analysis

- Known anomaly (probe outage): May 21 – June 4, 2024
- Best detection performance achieved using MAD method (F1 ≈ 0.33)
